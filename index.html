          <p>
            Not really. Around <strong>15%</strong> of the world's population,
            or estimated <strong>1 billion</strong> people, live with
            disabilities, they are the world's largest minority. The number of
            people with disability is dramatically increasing.

            How can you be so sure? Many people with disabilities like color
            blindness, limited motor skills, etc. use websites just like other
            users. Also, many
            <strong>assistive technologies are not detectable</strong> in any
            way.
